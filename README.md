# Installation
Sounds good! Where do we start? You need a computer with macOS or Windows (scroll down)

## Clover or OpenCore?
First let's figure out if we would like to use Clover or OpenCore. The pro's / con's listed:

### Clover
Pro's (+)
+ Most used, best supported online
+ Easy to configure with [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/)

Con's (-)
- Might be less compatible with macOS updates in the future
- Less secure (csr 67 flag needed to inject kext drivers, SIP, the macOS security system, is off)
- Need to put kext files in /Library/Extensions/

### OpenCore
Pro's (+)
+ Most secure (no csr 67 flag, SIP, the macOS security system, stays on)
+ Most compatible with future upgrades of macOS
+ No need to put kext files in /Library/Extensions/, therefore 'vanilla' macOS install
+ Faster than Clover

Con's (-)
- Complex to customise (Useful tool to edit config: https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)
- Unnofficial version [OpenCore Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/opencore-configurator/)
- Without Theme UI until release.

## Installing from macOS:
### Clover method:
* On your mac, create your macOS USB install media (e.g. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372)
* Mount the ESP (EFI System Partition) on your USB stick: (check that you mount the correct EFI partition, numbers will vary!!!)

```
diskutil list
sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk3s1
```
* Copy and overwrite the contents of the EFI folder on your USB stick with the contents of the EFI folder from this website.
* Eject the USB stick from your computer and insert in the Xiaomi laptop.
* Now boot the Xiaomi laptop from the install media (if trackpad is not working, use USB mouse. If network connection needed, use a Apple compatible USB Ethernet adapter)
* Open Disk Utility and format the builtin SSD or second SSD with APFS (will delete all your files!!!)
* Install macOS 
* After install, boot from USB again but select SSD to boot from in the Clover Bootloader
* Do initial macOS setup (use USB Ethernet adapter for internet)
* Mount the ESP (EFI System Partition) on your SSD (check that you mount the correct EFI partition, numbers will vary!!!)

```
diskutil list
sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk0s1
```
* Copy and overwrite the contents of the EFI folder from this website to the EFI folder on the ESP on your SSD.
* Copy all the Kernel Extensions (kexts) from the EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other to your system's /Library/Extensions folder (this is important, otherwise keyboard/trackpad and other devices might not work)
* Execute these commands in Terminal to rebuild Kernel Extension Cache:

```
sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/
sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/
sudo chmod -R 755 /Library/Extensions/
sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/
sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/
sudo touch /Library/Extensions/
sudo kextcache -i / && sudo kextcache -u /
```
* Remove the USB stick from the laptop
* Done! Reboot to enable all the kexts. Enjoy your Hackintosh!

### OpenCore method:
* On your mac, create your macOS USB install media (e.g. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372)

```
diskutil list
sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk3s1
```
* Copy and overwrite the contents of the EFI folder on your USB stick with the contents of the EFIOC (opencore) folder from this website.
* Eject the USB stick from your computer and insert in the Xiaomi laptop.
* Now boot the Xiaomi laptop from the install media (if trackpad is not working, use USB mouse. If network connection needed, use a Apple compatible USB Ethernet adapter)
* Open Disk Utility and format the builtin SSD or second SSD with APFS (will delete all your files!!!)

# macOS is working! Next steps:
### (optional) Fixing iMessage, FaceTime etc.
This can be a bit of a challenge, and outside of the scope of this repo, but if you want to, have a look here:<br />
[An iDiot's Guide To iMessage (clover)](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-imessage.196827/)<br />
[Fixing iServices (OpenCore)](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/extras/iservices)

### (optional) WiFi
Still very buggy, but improving fast. Have a look [here](https://github.com/johnnync13/Xiaomi-Mi-Air/tree/master/WIFI)

If your Intel Wifi not working, please **be patient**.

### (optional) Hackintosh combojack how to
[hackintosh-stuff](https://github.com/hackintosh-stuff) thanks to his repository we can fix the headphone jack: https://github.com/hackintosh-stuff/ComboJack


### (optional) High DPI display fix:
Since the text on the 13" display can be quite small for many people in 1920x1080 resolution, it's possible to use some of the High DPI scaling features of macOS. To enable those:

* Boot into the Recovery partition (in Clover hit (Fn+)F3 to show all partitions)
* We need to temporarily disable SIP. Run Terminal from the Utilities menu and run:
```
csrutil disable
```
* Reboot into normal macOS
* Open Terminal and run the [hidpi.sh](https://github.com/johnnync13/Xiaomi-Mi-Air/blob/master/HighDPI/hidpi.sh) script:
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/johnnync13/Xiaomi-Mi-Air/raw/master/HighDPI/hidpi.sh)"
```
* Choose (1) Enable, (3) MacBook Pro and (1) 1920x1080 Display.
* Reboot and test your new Display settings in System Preferences.
* When all set, reboot back into Recovery and enable SIP again:
```
csrutil enable
```
* Reboot into macOS. Done!


# Troubleshooting
### Some device in my system is not working under macOS!
Using Clover:
* Make sure all kexts are in /Library/Extensions/ then run:
```
sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/
sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/
sudo chmod -R 755 /Library/Extensions/
sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/
sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/
sudo touch /Library/Extensions/
sudo kextcache -i / && sudo kextcache -u /
```
* Reboot.

Using OpenCore:
* Make sure the kexts are in the EFI/OC/kexts folder on your SSD EFI system partition (ESP).
* Reboot. If still not working, try resetting the NVRAM from OpenCore boot menu.

**IMPORTANT:**
* It is really important on OpenCore, that the laptop have unlocked CFG Lock. It is important to CPU, sleep/wake and better behavior like native macOS. It is very easy on the most laptops because the BIOS has option in menu. But on Xiaomi Laptops, it is very simple with some steps on Windows. Maybe, make a video about it. 

# BIOS Modification

### Tutorial to modify BIOS  
* I would like make a script or others methods but this tutorial is like OpenCore method.  
* Soon I upload a csv with all xiaomi laptops that I have on the github with hexadecimal variables to unlock CFG Lock, MC Lock, SpeedShift and more.    
* ## THIS TUTORIAL IS AN EXAMPLE, NOT GET THE VALUES AND VARIABLES
  
## First of all, I am not responsible for what can happen to your laptop  
  
1- Boot with OpenCore  
2- Click on space key on keyboard.  
3- Select partition Mod Grub Shell  
4- Write a command method, for example to unlock cfg lock: setup_var 0x3C 0x00  
Other example, SpeedShift to enable: setup_var 0xB 0x01  
it is possible that for example, SpeedShift is enabled before.     
* ### Explanation:  
setup_var is to call method function.  
0x3C is the location memory on bios that is variable CFG Lock.    
0x00 is to disable and 0x01 is to enable. I put the example here.  
(default) is how the variable is when you install a BIOS, that is, by the manufacturer.  

One Of: CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x3C, VarStore: 0x3, QuestionId: 0x146, Size: 1, Min:   0x0, Max 0x1, Step: 0x0 {05 91 8A 02 8B 02 46 01 03 00 3C 00 10 10 00 01 00}  
0x149413 			One Of Option: Disabled, Value (8 bit): 0x0 {09 07 04 00 00 00 00}  
0x14941A 			One Of Option: Enabled, Value (8 bit): 0x1 (default) {09 07 03 00 30 00 01}  
0x149421 		End One Of {29 02}  
  
5- You can set up more variables to modify Bios. If you want exit, you must write reboot and click enter on keyboard.  
  
6- You can verify the CFG is unlocked or other parametres like SpeedShift is enabled in hackintool, section Utilities and press button Get AppleIntelInfo.
